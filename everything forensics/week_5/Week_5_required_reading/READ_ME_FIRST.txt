This week's reading can be quite challenging for some people.

The folder called 'cases', the content may be potentially disturbing. 
You may skip these readings.
However, do note that it will be discussed in Week 5's Lecture, 
but you will not be assessed on these cases. 

The folder called 'court transcripts required sections' has only the required 
sections from the court transcripts that you need to read. 

The rest of the court transcript (again, potentially disturbing) 
is in the folder 'court transcripts'.

The rest of the files may also contain distressing content.
